            <dl>
                <dt>Songs</dt>
                    <dd>This album contains songs. The songs have beginnings, middles, and ends. The melodies are present. The rhythms occur. It is, objectively, an album.</dd>
                <dt>More Songs</dt>
                    <dd>Following the precedent set by 'Songs,' this album delivers additional songs. The sonic experience continues. Listeners will hear sounds. The sounds are arranged. Satisfaction is statistically probable.</dd>
                <dt>Even More Songs</dt>
                    <dd>An ambitious expansion of the 'Songs' universe. The songs are still songs. There may be instruments. There may be vocals. There is definitely audio. Fans of sound will appreciate the continued existence of sound.</dd>
                <dt>All The Songs</dt>
                    <dd>This album contains all the songs. Not some. Not most. All. It is a comprehensive sonic archive. The listening experience is long. The songs are sequential. The emotional range is statistically significant. For fans of 'Songs,' 'More Songs,' and 'Even More Songs,' this is the final form. Completion has been achieved. There is nothing left to add. Or subtract. It is the musical equivalent of a full hard drive.</dd>
